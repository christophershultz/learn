# Information Integration

II = Using many different information sources to accomplish a task. 

As M&As happen, databases from separate companies need to be combined / integrated. We may not want to actually migrate this information into one database, but we might want to invest in an integration system that combines everything into one view. 

The "Big" Problem
* Many sources: hundreds of tables, schema mapping problem is a combinatorial challenge. 
* Pay-as-you-go model. Only integrate sources when they're needed.
* Probabilistic schema mapping. 

Data Exchange: 
* Given a source db with a finite number of relations, a set of schema mappings, and a set of constraints that the target schema must satisfy, the data exchange problem is to find a finite target db such that both the schema mappings and the target constraints are satisfied. 

Data Fusion
* Data Sources
* Data Items: product, part of product, feature, etc. 
* Using data from a subset of sources find the true value or true distribution of the data item. 
* Assemble all such values for the real-world entity represented by the data items. 

# Splunk and Datameer

Splunk is a suite of products for data management. Splunk collects and indexes data at massive scale, from wherever it's generated, regardless of format or source. Users can search, monitor, analyze, and report on their data all in real-time.
