# Querying JSON with MongoDB

Recall that JSON data can be thought of as a tree. The atomic structure of JSON is a key-value pair. The value can also be an array/list. So the query operations on it can be either about its position in the list or its value.  

SQL SELECT and MongoDB find()
* MongoDB is a collection of documents. The basic query primitive. 

```
db.collection.find(<query filter>, <projection>).<cursor modifier>
```

collection is like the FROM clause, and specifies which collection to use. 

The "query filter" Is like the WHERE clause. Specifies which info to return. If we want to return everything, this is left blank.

The "projection" clause is the list of variables we want to see in the output. 

The "Cursor Modifier" allows you to modify how much and what portion of results you want. 

In SQL, we might write: `SELECT * FROM BEERS`. In MongoDB, we might write `db.Beers.find()`. 

Similarly, `SELECT BEER, PRICE FROM SELLS`. In MongoDB, this would be something like

```
db.Sells.find(
    {},
    {beer:1, price:1}
)
```
